# 👨‍💻 ****About me****
I'm a .NET developer with 4+ years of experience working on enterprise and web applications but now I’m also developing my own side projects.  
Most of my work is focused on **ASP.NET Core**, **Entity Framework**, and **SQL Server**, but I also use **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Bootstrap** when building user interfaces.    
   
Over the years I’ve worked on:
*   building **MVC**, **APIs** and microservices,
*   integrating systems with **SQL databases** (MS SQL, Oracle),
*   writing and optimizing **stored procedures**,
*   setting up **CI/CD pipelines**
 
On GitHub I share:
*   portfolio projects,
*   implementing **authentication and authorization** with Identity,
- experiments with **data visualization (D3.js + TypeScript)**,
- practical examples of backend and database integration.

Always open to learning from others and improving my approach to writing software.
